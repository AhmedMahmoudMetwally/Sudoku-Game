# Sudoku-Game
Sudoku is a logic-based number-placement game that challenges players to fill a 9x9 grid with  digits from 1 to 9. The objective is to complete the grid in such a way that each row, each  column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (also known as regions or boxes) contains all of the  digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.
